## Introduction
Orochi is an Ethereum file hosting sidechain.

Decentralised storage solutions like IPFS is not ideal for non-fungible storage. With these systems, files are stored by hashing files, where uniqueness is not guaranteed. Meanwhile, NFT marketplaces have needs like complying with law enforcement and regulation, whereas these storage solutions cannot guarantee that the files stored on its system are in compliance with the law. Users also have needs like guaranteeing uptime of the file.

Orochi seeks to solve these in a simple file storage solution built specifically for NFTs where:
- files are always unique (never hashed)
- Marketplaces can choose to host or decline to host an NFT, and be fully in compliance with the law
- Users can choose which marketplaces will host their NFTs
- Marketplaces can charge a fee for hosting NFTs and as such open up a new source of revenue for marketplaces (similar to a subscription revenue source)
- Users can choose to move NFT hosting from marketplace to marketplace, and never lose an NFT just because a marketplace took it down
